The NULL and nullptr keywords in C++ both represent null pointer constants, but they have different properties and behaviors. Here's a detailed comparison:

**NULL**
Definition: NULL is a macro defined in several standard libraries (like <cstddef>, <cstdlib>, <climits>, etc.).
Type: NULL is typically defined as 0 or (void*)0.
Usage: It can be used to represent a null pointer value in C and C++.
Type Safety: NULL lacks type safety. Since it is usually defined as 0, it can lead to ambiguous situations and unintended type conversions, especially in function overloads.

**nullptr**
Definition: nullptr is a keyword introduced in C++11.
Type: nullptr is of type std::nullptr_t.
Usage: It is specifically used to represent a null pointer value in C++.
Type Safety: nullptr is type-safe. It does not implicitly convert to integers or other types, reducing the risk of errors in code, especially with function overloading and template instantiations.


**Example of Type Safety**
Consider the following function overloads:

void func(int);
void func(char*);

If you call func(NULL), the compiler might get confused because NULL is defined as 0, which can be implicitly converted to an int, causing func(int) to be called instead of func(char*).

However, if you use func(nullptr), there is no ambiguity because nullptr is specifically a null pointer constant of type std::nullptr_t, so func(char*) will be called.

**Example Code**
Here's an example to illustrate the differences:

#include <iostream>

void func(int) {
    std::cout << "Called func(int)\n";
}

void func(char*) {
    std::cout << "Called func(char*)\n";
}

int main() 
{
    func(NULL);    // Ambiguous call, might call func(int) or func(char*)
    
    func(nullptr); // Unambiguous call, will call func(char*)
    
    return 0;
}

**Key Differences**
Type Safety: nullptr is type-safe and preferred in modern C++ code, whereas NULL can lead to ambiguous situations due to its definition as 0.
Function Overloading: Using nullptr helps avoid ambiguity in function overload resolution, while NULL can lead to unexpected behavior.
Templates: nullptr works better with templates, reducing the risk of errors due to type conversion.

**Recommendation**
In modern C++ (C++11 and later), it is recommended to use nullptr instead of NULL for null pointer constants to take advantage of type safety and avoid potential issues with function overloading and template instantiation.
